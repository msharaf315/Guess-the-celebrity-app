# Guess-the-celebrity-app
this is a demo application that was made for learning the web downloading content process in androoid development
I download the html file from a website listing the top 100 celebrities then filtring through the text and adding the images and 
names of the celebrities into arrays and displaying a random picture and name for the user to choose
this method is not reliable  as I cannot control the html file of the website and any change will lead to my application 
crashing
